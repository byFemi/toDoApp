# Android To Do App

### Description 
This is the first Android app I've created and it exposed me to the process of android development.
During this project I followed the Codepath guide and was exposed to concepts such as:
- Wireframing
- The concept of API Versions
- The Android Activity system.
- The Android UI - layout - and behaviour(.java) system.
- XML Serialization


### User Stories
This To-Do list app allows users to:
- Add and remove items from a todo list
- Tap an item in the list and bring up an edit screen for the item.
- Change the todo list item 
- Save the changes and see them reflect
- Persist the changes to be retrieved on app restart
